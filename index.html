My dad could no longer operate a CD player or iPod. But he could use the music player that I designed and made for him, because it operates like a familiar two-knob radio. I was inspired to make this by the documentary <u><a href="http://www.aliveinside.us/#land">Alive Inside</a></u> which shows the profound joy felt by some people with dementia when listening to their favorite music.

<h2 style="margin-top:1em;line-height:0;">Can I make one?</h2>
Yes! It doesn't require much technical skill. No soldering. No woodworking. It mostly requires following the instructions. Takes 3-5 hours, depending on the model. Things you'll be doing: ordering parts, applying glue, screwing things in, plugging in wires, downloading software, and maybe applying some linseed oil to the wood. Also, it's the kind of project that friends and family would be happy to help you with.
<h2 style="margin-top:1.5em;line-height:0;">What does it cost?</h2>
I don't sell anything - this is open source. I publish very clear step-by-step instructions with good photographs. You do need some electronic parts - the instructions have a list of electronic parts, which usually cost about $60. And you need the custom case. Most people simply mail order the case from an online laser shop for $30 - $50. Alternatively, if you have access to a 3D printer or laser cutter, you can make the case yourself using my open source design files.

<em>I recently assembled a dqmusicbox per your instructions - and it just . worked. Yesterday I turned over my incarnation of the box to my father. It has been a long time since I saw such an emotional reaction from him. I let him at it without explanations at all, and he made it work without instructions. ... Some of his favorites triggered immediate responses - I should have filmed it.</em> -- Ketil
